## Regular expression
## We first check regex.h provided by libc.
## NOTE: we will not use PCRE posix because of potential
## linking problem. For example, when we include <pcreposix.h>,
## during linking, libc library may be used instead of the pcre library. 
## That will crash our program. So we wont use PCRE (@LIB_PCRE@).
